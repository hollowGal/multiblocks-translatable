Example static multiblock plugin scaffolded with Create Block tool.

== Description ==
it is based on a multiple-boilerplate2 https://github.com/hollowGal/multiple-boilerplate2
Still each block folder is built into its own output folder - 
only adapted to be translatable :
	- removed editorScript handle from block.json and enqueue the script (in a loop in the main plugin file)
	- set each block script translation in the loop


== Installation ==

e.g.

1. Upload the plugin files to the `/wp-content/plugins/multiblocks-translatable` directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.
